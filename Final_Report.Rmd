## Data Background

#### Context
The Formula 1 World Championship has been one of the premier forms of auto racing around the world since its inaugural season in 1950. The word "formula" refers to the set of rules to which all participants' cars must conform. A Formula 1 season consists of a series of Grands Prix races which take place worldwide on circuits and closed public roads.

#### Source
The [Formula 1 World Championships](https://www.kaggle.com/rohanrao/formula-1-world-championship-1950-2020) dataset consists of all information on the Formula 1 races, drivers, constructors, qualifying, circuits, lap times, pit stops, and championships for every season from 1950 to 2020.

This dataset was published by Rohan Rao, a Data Scientist who goes by the name [Vopani](https://www.kaggle.com/rohanrao) on Kaggle. (Fun fact: he is also the reigning National Sudoku Champion of India.) He compiled this dataset using the [Ergast Developer API](http://ergast.com/mrd/), an experimental web service that provides a historical record of motor racing data for non-commercial purposes. The API provides data specifically for the Formula One series, from the beginning of the world championships in 1950 up to the present season.

The Ergast API website does not give any details about their data collection procedures, but their data is very thorough and complete. Additionally, Formula 1 world championships are internationally televised and race results are publicly accessible information [(see official Formula 1 website)](https://www.formula1.com/en/results.html), so there is no reason to doubt the accuracy of the data reported.

## Investigation Question

#### Does the car or the driver have the greater impact?

Unlike most sports, Formula 1 racing is heavily reliant on the performance capability of their equipment, which is their cars that are created by the constructors. To what extent do the constructor and driver predict race performance, and which one has the greater predictive capability?

----------------------------------------

## Data Tidying

The data came in many separate files, including `results.csv`, `drivers.csv`, `constructors.csv`, `circuits.csv`, `races.csv`, `status.csv`, and `laptimes.csv`. Our first step was to join all of these data frames together by their relevant ID numbers and replace the missing values with `NA`.

In our dataset we kept these columns: 

- resultId
- raceId
- driverId
- constructorId
- positionOrder
- laps
- fastestLapSpeed
- statusId
- driver_name
- constructor_name
- year
- round
- circuitId
- race_name
- status
- circuit_name

```{r, include=FALSE}
#df_data %>% glimpse()
```

#### Time data

The column `milliseconds` reports the race completion time for all of the drivers that were able to finish the race. However, drivers are often unable to complete the full race due to collisions, car breakdowns, or other problems, leaving many missing values for total race time. We discarded `milliseconds` and created a second dataset where we supplemented information from `laptimes.csv` to compute total race time even when race status was not finished. The lap times were understandably missing when the number of laps completed was 0, so we removed these observations. Overall, we still only have lap times for 9,233 of our 24,900 though. 

In this time-filtered dataset we added these columns: 

- total_time
- avg_lap
- circuit_avg_lap
- circuit_lap_sd
- std_avg_lap

```{r, include=FALSE}
#df_timedata %>% glimpse()
```

#### Potential Problems

- Some examples of [constructor name changes](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1dos3r/i_made_a_diagram_to_show_how_current_f1_teams/)
- Rules Era can change performance
- New drivers are skewed because they don't have as many data points yet
- This data is for 70 years of races and [formula racing has changed a lot](https://youtu.be/hgLQWIAaCmY)
  - Consider filtering on year >= 2000

----------------------------------------

## Exploratory Data Analysis
 
#### Standardized Average Lap Time

```{r finish race, echo=FALSE}
df_data %>% 
  group_by(positionOrder) %>%
  mutate(mean_laps = mean(laps)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  ggplot(aes(positionOrder, mean_laps)) +
  geom_point() + 
  labs(
    y = "Mean laps completed",
    x = "Final position"
  ) + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  geom_line(color = "blue")
```

As shown in the graph above, final position is heavily reliant on how many laps the driver was able to complete. And almost a third of the time, collisions or car troubles put drivers out of commission before the race is finished. These final standings are not reflective of how well the driver was doing before that point, so we decided to use average lap time to create a more comprehensive performance metric.

Average lap time is a comprehensive measure of how well a driver performed in a race because it is informed only on the laps they were able to complete, unlike final position. The only problem is that it doesn't account for the effect of circuit on lap time, so we need to correct for this difference across circuits.

```{r average lap time per circuit, echo=FALSE}
df_timedata %>%
  ggplot(aes(fct_reorder(as.factor(circuitId), avg_lap), avg_lap)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1)) + 
  labs(
    x = "Circuit ID number",
    y = "Average lap time (ms)"
  )
```

The average lap time varies across circuits due to the differences in track length and shape, so we need a way to compare average lap time across circuits. Dividing average lap time by average lap time per circuit doesn't work because it doesn't account for the range of average lap time on each circuit. To correct for the impact of circuit on average lap time, we standardized by circuit:

$$\mu = \sum_{i}^{n} \frac{x_i}{n}$$

$$\sigma = \sqrt{\sum_{i}^{n} \frac{(x_i - \mu)^2}{n}}$$

$$z = \frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}$$

where $x$ is the data, $\mu$ is the mean, $\sigma$ is the standard deviation, and $z$ is the standard score of $x$

#### Standardized Average Lap Time by Circuit

```{r, echo = FALSE}
df_timedata %>%
  ggplot(aes(fct_reorder(as.factor(circuitId), std_avg_lap), std_avg_lap)) +
  geom_boxplot() + 
  labs(
    x = "Circuit ID number",
    y = "standardized average lap time"
#    title = "Comparing standardized average lap time by circuit"
  ) + 
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```

The graph above shows a visual comparison of standardized average lap time by circuit. The slope of the median is small in magnitude relative to the range of the standardized average lap time, showing that standardizing the average lap time successfully minimizes the effect of circuit. 

#### Driver and Constructor by Standardized Average Lap Time

```{r fig.width = 20,fig.height=10, echo=FALSE}
#df_timedata %>%
#  mutate(driver_name = fct_reorder(as.character(driver_name),std_avg_lap))%>%
#  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = driver_name, y = std_avg_lap)) +
#  geom_boxplot() +
#  theme_minimal() +
##  ylim(-2,2) +
#  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90,vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))+
#  labs(x = "Driver Name",y = "Standardized Average Lap Time (ms)")

df_timedata %>%
  mutate(constructor_name = fct_reorder(as.character(constructor_name),std_avg_lap))%>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = constructor_name, y = std_avg_lap)) +
  geom_boxplot()+
  theme_minimal() +
  ylim(-2,2) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90,vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))+
  labs(x = "Vehicle Constructor Name",y = "Standardized Average Lap Time (ms)")
```

Constructor and standardized average lap time appear to have a positive and fairly linear relationship. This makes sense because standardizing should correct the distribution to become more linear. Seeing that constructor has an impact on standard average lap time is a good sign because it indicates that there may be some causality and therefore also predictive capability.

#### Modelling by standard average lap time

```{r modeling the entire data set}
fullfit_driver <-
  df_timedata %>%
  lm(
    data = .,
    formula = std_avg_lap ~ as.factor(driverId)
  )
print("Full Fit - Just Driver")
cat("Rsquare", rsquare(fullfit_driver, df_timedata), "\n")
cat("MSE", mse(fullfit_driver, df_timedata), "\n")
fullfit_constructor <- 
  df_timedata %>% 
  lm(
    data = .,
    formula = std_avg_lap ~ as.factor(constructorId)
  )
print("Full Fit - Just Constructor")
cat("Rsquare", rsquare(fullfit_constructor, df_timedata), "\n")
cat("MSE", mse(fullfit_constructor, df_timedata), "\n")
fullfit_driver_constructor <- 
  df_timedata %>% 
  lm(
    data = .,
    formula = std_avg_lap ~ as.factor(driverId) + as.factor(constructorId)
  )
print("Full Fit - Driver and Constructor")
cat("Rsquare", rsquare(fullfit_driver_constructor, df_timedata), "\n")
cat("MSE", mse(fullfit_driver_constructor, df_timedata), "\n")
```

Looking at our mean square error first we can compare our different models against one another. Between models, the error is lowest with both `driver and constructor` which is a good sign that both are informative towards lap time. The order of best model to worst, solely based upon MSE, is driver and constructor, just driver, and finally just constructor. These results may imply that driver is a better predictor of outcome than constructor, but this is not necessarily the case.

Looking next at our rsquared value we see that our models do **not** have very good coverage of the data. We are looking at each model only covering around `4.6% to 8.1%` of the data, which calls into question the validity the comparisons made for our MSE. The order of best model to worst, solely based upon rsquare, is driver and constructor, just driver, and finally just constructor, so the overall standings seem to follow the exact same trend seen in both MSE and rsquare.

These models should be taken with a grain or more of salt as we are using the entire data set to create them, so we don't have a separate training and validation data set. However, using a split of the dataset for training and the rest for validation will not increase the accuracy of the model. With such a low predictive capability already it doesn't appear to be useful to fit additional models.

## Final Position

#### Driver and Constructor by Final Position

```{r fig.width = 20,fig.height=15, echo=FALSE}
#df_data %>%
#  mutate(driver_name = fct_reorder(as.character(driver_name),positionOrder))%>%
#  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = driver_name, y = positionOrder)) +
#  geom_boxplot() +
#  theme_minimal() +
#  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90,vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))+
#  labs(x = "Driver Name",y = "Final position")

#df_data %>%
#  mutate(constructor_name = fct_reorder(as.character(constructor_name),positionOrder))%>%
#  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = constructor_name, y = positionOrder)) +
#  geom_boxplot()+
#  theme_minimal() +
#  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90,vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))+
# labs(x = "Vehicle Constructor Name",y = "Final position")

df_data %>%
  summarise(mean_pos = mean(positionOrder))

df_data %>%
  mutate(mean_pos = mean(positionOrder)) %>%
  group_by(constructor_name) %>%
  mutate(mean_posOrder = mean(positionOrder)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(constructor_name = fct_reorder(as.character(constructor_name),mean_posOrder))%>%
  
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x = constructor_name, y = mean_posOrder))+
  geom_abline(aes(slope=0, intercept=mean_pos, color="red")) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90,vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))+
  labs(x = "Vehicle Constructor Name",y = "Mean final position")
```

Constructor and final position have an interesting relationship that is not linear. There are also relatively few constructors with a mean final position of less than the overall average final position.

#### Modelling by Final Position

#### Probability Intervals

If possible given your data, report all estimates with confidence / prediction / tolerance intervals. If not possible, clearly explain why it is not possible to provide intervals and document what sources of uncertainty are not quantified.
